TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.



I have no idea what exercise2.py is about honestly. - Solved, Test file was not working.
I got some ideas about list append
I don't have to declare variables everytime when I use list
Some instructions are really vaig. Not matching to examples
Exercise 3, Keep in mind about shortcuts - 
    #rather than for k in range(width): row.append("*")
    you could also use #row = ["*"] * height
